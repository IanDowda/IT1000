# _My High School Career_

I attended school in **Aurora, Colorado** called [Vista Peak Preparatory](https://vistapeakprep.aurorak12.org/) from 2010 to 2014. The school introduced into the district a varied class structure. Beyond the general education classes an option for 'specialization' or 'pathway learning' was introduced. The options were:

  Art
  
  Business
  
  Medicine
  
  S.T.E.M.

I chose the S.T.E.M path and learned a lot while I was there. I was introduced to 3D printing, AutoCAD and even hardware assembly through soldering.
