Living in Missouri has been a great experience so far. My wife and I hope to live here permanantly. Given the large agricultural influence here and the rise in technology in that field, I'm somewhat hopeful to find a career here in technology service for farming equipment. This state seems like a good place to bring up a family. If my degree in **Information Technology** doesnt work out I plan to return to this college for a _Masters degree_ in Library Sciences.
