For the last nearly 5 years I worked for the company [Micro Center](https://www.microcenter.com/). I joined the comapny at the _Denver, CO_ location in their General Sales department. I sold various cables, accessories, and services. I was able to help the customers with the aid of my spanish speaking skills. After about a year I transferred into the Consumer Electronics(CE) department. At the Denver location the CE depatrment focuses on Televisions, Mobile Devices, and accompaning accessories (cases, wires, sound bars, streaming devices, etc.). In May 2022 my wife and I moved to the _Kansas City, KS_ area to work at the **Overland Park** location in the Build Your Own PC department. I left the company in July of 2022 to temporarily return to Colorado in preparation to attend [college](https://github.com/IanDowda/IT1000/blob/2a84c660093680eb36eb6be2357764009052bf7a/README.md).
